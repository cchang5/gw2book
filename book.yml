#Dictionary of transactions

#Help:
#spidyid - id for the item of interest. Go to www.gw2spidy.com, search for the item. The URL will say http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/XXXXX where XXXXX is the id.
#buy_price - how much you bought the item for in the format g..gsscc (gold..gold,silversilver,coppercopper). For example. 23s00c = 2300.  If you bought a legendary, then 4023g12s99c = 40231299
#buy_date - Day that you bought it. Figure this out later. Stupid timezones.
